Muddle
------

	Muddle is a MUD client written by Brett Vickers (bvickers@uci.edu)
to use with Mordor (mud server).  It will work with many other types of
mud servers as well.  Everything is included here that is necessary for
you to create your own binary version.  It supports multiple connections,
macros, and limited bot capabilities. 

	This software is known to work on SunOS 4.0, FreeBSD, and Linux.
Just type 'make' and you should shortly have a working version.
	This program looks for a file named '.muddle' which configures 
your sites, macros, and bots.  Use the sample.muddle file as a template 
for your personalized .muddle.	
	If you find this program useful, drop Brett a note thanking him 
for his efforts.  If you have questions about this distribution, mail
